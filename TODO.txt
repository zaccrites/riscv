- FENCE instruction
- CSRs and exceptions
- Illegal function modes for e.g. LOAD instructions are not verified
  by the control unit during instruction decode.


- Create script to run Dhrystone on various microarchitectures
  to see how changes improve or hurt performance.


- Create script or makefile to invoke Vivado using Tcl non-project mode
  (or project mode, whatever makes most sense-- just no GUI)
