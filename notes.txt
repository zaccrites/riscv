Next Steps:

* Fix memory read/write problems
* Fix/expand unit tests?
* Clean up simulator code
* Add SYSTEM instructions (any others missing?)
* Add CSR instructions and exceptions

* Pipeline the CPU!
    - Does this solve the "synchronous memory" issue?
      Do I need to register the memory unit outputs?

* Implement caches and C++ "main memory"

...

* Implement C++ "disk" and SPI interface





Other issues:

- When I refactored the `define includes and removed cpudefs.sv,
  Ninja complained about it missing and not being able to build
  Vmodule cmake files which depended on it. I would like the
  system to be able to recover from a situation like that, if possible.

- Adding the step to dump `defines effectively doubles Verilation time.
  Is there a smarter way to do this?
